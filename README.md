# ImageRegistration
This is a code for image registration. I did this as a homework for Principles of Image Processing Course. This code can automatically register most of the images in Prokudin-Gorskii image dataset.
If you want to test this code on an image, change the f_name variable to the directory of your image.
Sample input image can be downloaded by the following link:
